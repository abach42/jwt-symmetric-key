# Spring Security JWT - Symmetric Key

How to Implement Symmetric Key Encryption in Spring Security

I created a [tutorial](https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2022/09/06/spring-security-jwt/ ) on how to use asymmetric encryption using JWTs in Spring Security. One of the questions I received from that was how to do the same using symmetric encryption. This tutorial contains a simplified
version of that using a shared secret key.
